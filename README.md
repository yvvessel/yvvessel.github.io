## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Buttons with hover effects](https://enjeck.com/btns/) - For hover effects

### What I learned

Learned that majorly links "buttons" are not actually buttons and made a cool-looking link "button" with it's logos.

```html
<a href="https://github.com/yvvessel/" title="Perfil do Github" class="button flash-slide flash-slide--black"> 

            <img class="imagens"src="Images index/github-mark.png" alt="Logotipo Github"/>

            Github
       
</a>
```
Create layout with responsiveness, accessibility and visual designs.

```css
.impobjetos {
  max-width: fit-content;
  margin: auto;
  width: 50%;
  min-height: auto;
  padding: 50px;
  border-radius: 25px;
  background-color: rgb(32, 32, 32);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); 
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Developer Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This helped me helped me gain basic knowledge of various aspects such as hyperlinks, flexbox and responsiveness.
- [W3SCHOOLS](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3schools helped me a lot with specific questions I had in both css and html.
